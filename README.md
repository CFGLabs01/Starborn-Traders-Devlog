**Comprehensive Development Catch-Up: Foundations to Features**

This devlog entry provides a broad overview of the development progress for Starborne Traders, covering foundational work through to more recent feature implementation and UI/UX refinements.

**I. Foundational Asset Design & Integration:**

*   **Game Art & Aesthetic Direction:**
    *   Initial concepts for the game's art style, focusing on a blend of sci-fi aesthetics, holographic elements, and faction-specific visual identities.
    *   Exploration of UI themes, including color palettes (e.g., `--rgb-rich-black`, `--rgb-midnight-green`, `--rgb-tiffany-blue`), font choices (`Goldman`, `Audiowide`), and overall visual language for panels, buttons, and interactive elements.
*   **3D Model Preparation & Initial Views:**
    *   Work on integrating 3D models for key game assets (e.g., ships, characters, planets â€“ implied by components like `ShipModelViewer`, character detail modals).
    *   Setting up basic 3D preview capabilities within UI panels.
*   **Asset Pipeline Considerations:**
    *   Early planning for asset generation pipelines, considering how 2D UI elements and 3D models would be created, imported, and managed within the React/Three.js environment.

**II. UI/UX Framework & Core Panel Development:**

*   **Reusable Modal System:**
    *   Development of a flexible `SelectionModal.jsx` component for displaying detailed information (e.g., character details, ship specs, planet info).
    *   Styling for modal backdrops (`modal-backdrop`) and panels (`popup-panel`, `modal-panel`) to create a cohesive look and feel, including experiments with frosted glass effects, borders, and shadows.
    *   Integration of Framer Motion for smooth modal animations.
*   **Character & Item Selection Screens:**
    *   Structuring UI for character selection, ship selection, and planet selection screens.
    *   Implementing grid layouts for displaying selectable cards (`selection-card`) and placeholder content for detailed views.
*   **CSS Architecture & Styling:**
    *   Establishing a CSS structure using global styles, theme variables (`theme.css`), component-specific styles (`panels.css`, `buttons.css`), and Tailwind CSS for utility classes.
    *   Focus on creating a responsive and visually appealing interface.

**III. Advanced 3D Component Development:**

*   **`GlowingWireframeSphere` Component:**
    *   Creation of a reusable 3D "GlowingWireframeSphere" React component using React-Three-Fiber and custom GLSL shaders.
    *   This component features a dynamic latitude-based color gradient (e.g., teal to orange) and controllable emissive visual effects, designed for representing celestial bodies or other spherical game elements.
    *   Configurable props for radius, wireframe thickness, colors, opacity, and emissive intensity.
    *   Initial demonstration within a dedicated HUD example (`HudExample.jsx`).

**IV. System Integration & Troubleshooting:**

*   **Starfield Background Implementation:**
    *   Integration of the Drei `<Stars />` component for a dynamic starfield background.
    *   Troubleshooting display issues to ensure full-screen rendering and proper layering with UI elements.
*   **Dependency Management & Build Issues:**
    *   Addressed and resolved `npm install` challenges related to peer dependencies, particularly with `@react-three/postprocessing` and React-Three-Fiber versioning.
*   **Ongoing UI/UX Refinements:**
    *   Iterative diagnosis and fixing of UI display bugs, such as the "tiny square" starfield issue and ensuring correct background opacity for various screens.
    *   Continuous investigation into the modal backdrop transparency to achieve the desired semi-transparent and blurred effect over the starfield. This has involved resolving CSS conflicts, standardizing color variables, and testing different CSS alpha blending approaches.

**Current Status & Next Steps:**
*   The modal backdrop transparency remains a key focus for resolution.
*   Efforts will continue to restore and enhance the visual fidelity of the starfield, aiming for a more dynamic and multi-layered appearance.
*   The overarching goal is to solidify a reliable prototype with a deeply engaging "open star field" environment and polished UI interactions.
